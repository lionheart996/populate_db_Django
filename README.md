This Django script automates the process of populating a database with randomly generated data. It defines a function, populate_model_with_data, which takes a Django model and a specified number of records (num_records) to create.

The function:

Iterates through the modelâ€™s fields, assigning random but valid values based on field types (e.g., integers, text, email, dates, decimals).

Supports foreign key and one-to-one relationships by selecting random existing records from related models.

Handles many-to-many relationships by randomly associating multiple related objects.

This script is useful for generating test data in Django applications, making it easier to work with populated databases during development and testing. ðŸš€
